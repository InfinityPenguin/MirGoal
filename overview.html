					<p> MirGoal is a clinical-application biotechnology company developing a broad pipeline of leading microRNA-based oncology diagnostics, the first to be tested in cancer patients. </p>
					<h3 class="page-header"> Company </h3>
					<p> MirGoal was newly founded in 2015 to take the mission to advance the micro RNA technologies for its applications in medical diagnostics.  We are committed to providing professional, state-of-the-art research and development laboratory services to pharmaceutical industry, clinical laboratories, members of molecular diagnostic and clinical communities, and academic researchers. </p>
					<h3 class="page-header"> Mission </h3>
					<p> We strive to be recognized as the preferred provider of research and development services that lead to new laboratory testing and professional interpretative services in laboratory diagnostics specialized in MicroRNAs.  We strive to become a global leader in microRNA laboratory science from U.S. to solve difficult cases beyond the competency of ordinary clinical reference laboratories. Just as important to us, we seek to make real contributions to our community through the excellence of our services, professional interactions with our clients, and the education of future leaders in the areas of microRNA. 

					Developed under the direction of microRNA experts renowned throughout the academic and medical fields, MirGoal intends to develop a portfolio of a unique menu of cancer diagnostic and treatment tests&mdash;all readily available to clients ranging from hospitals and universities, to reference laboratories.  We provide expertise, service and innovation that cannot find anywhere else. </p>	
					<h3 class="page-header"> Core Competency </h3>
					<p> Our core competency is to academic and medical research on miRNAs, and the ability to establish all components required offering a robust clinical laboratory test for routine operation in reference laboratories, and at the point of care.  Our in-depth understanding of the need of contract research from pharmaceutical companies is also an important component of the companies' asset.

					MirGoal is currently composed of 5 highly trained and well experienced professionals. We have a staff dedicated to clinical and contracted research businesses including: Pathologist Dr. Huiqing Wu, statisticians and medical researcher Dr. Xiwei Wu, Dr. Ju Jingfang, a pioneer academic researcher with leadership in translational medicine in microRNA research field, and Dr. Dongling Ma, a PhD. senior scientist that conducts hands-on experiments, and design all operational details for a routine clinical laboratory test.  

					President and CEO Dr. Wenzhe Li is a PhD certified clinical chemist, well trained in academic settings as well as clinical laboratory and industrial settings.  Experienced in management of R&amp;D and business development, she will lead the team to execute the commercialization plan.
